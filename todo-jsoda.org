** DONE Refactor object caching service out of Jsoda
** DONE Refactor and clean up the Jsoda class.
** DONE Support delete by id/rangekey, int/long/Integer/Long
** DONE Unit test delete in SimpleDB and DynamoDB.
** DONE Support batchDelete on id/rangekey, int/long/Integer/Long
** DONE Refactor query construction.  Pass Query object to DbService implementation class to generate native query.
   Move SimpleDB query generation from Query to SimpleDBMgr.
** DONE Support mixing of Select Id, other_fields for SimpleDB query.
   1. Support standalone Select Id => Select itemName() as before.
   2. Support Select Id, other1, other2 => Select other1, other2.  Fill in Id in post query processing.
** DONE Fill in Id/RangeKey in post query processing for DynamoDB when only other fields are selected.
** DONE Support select count(*) in Query, for SimpleDB.
** DONE Support select count(*) in Query, for DynamoDB.
** DONE Add unit test for select count(*) for different queries.
** DONE Add query support for DynamoDB.
** DONE Support scan in Query.  For DynamoDB, if query has a filter on Id AND a filter on ARangeKey, do query.  Otherwise, do scan.
** DONE Support building filter conditions in DynamoDB
** DONE Support condition comparison: EQ, NE, IN, LE, LT, GE, GT, BETWEEN, NOT_NULL, NULL, CONTAINS, NOT_CONTAINS, BEGINS_WITH
** DONE Add DSL methods to Query for comparison: EQ, NE, IN, LE, LT, GE, GT, BETWEEN, NOT_NULL, NULL, CONTAINS, NOT_CONTAINS, BEGINS_WITH
** DONE For DynamoDB, filter's field must be the ARangeKey field
** TODO For DynamoDB, order by field must be the ARangeKey field.  Asc/Desc change the scan direction.

** TODO Support Atomic Counters in DynamoDB and emulate in SimpleDB
** TODO Ensure operand value type is same as the argument field type in SdbFilter.
** TODO Add id and rangekey attributes to AttrFieldMap in Jsoda.  Use ITEMS() for Id attr in Simpledb.
** TODO Support Serializable field object.
** TODO Support S3 field
** TODO Support Set<> data type for field.  Native mapping for DynamoDB.  Json mapping for Simpledb.
** TODO Validate the list supported field data types.
** TODO Iterator for query result.  Add flag to disable caching objects in list result.
** TODO Index table for DynamoDB
** TODO Add field default value generators.
