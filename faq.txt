Q:  Why do I get "com.amazonaws.AmazonClientException: Unable to execute HTTP request: peer not authenticated"?
A:  The JVM's certificate for https has not been set up correctly.
    If you don't want to use https in AWS, set the service endpoint to use http url.
    See http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Endpoints.html for DynamoDB.

Q:  Is the OR condition operation supported in query?
A:  No.  Only AND operations are supported in query.
    E.g. jsoda.query(Model1.class).gt("age", 20).lt("age", 40) would produce a query of: select * from Model1 where age > 20 AND age < 40
