Q:  Why do I get "com.amazonaws.AmazonClientException: Unable to execute HTTP request: peer not authenticated"?
A:  The JVM's certificate for https has not been set up correctly.
    If you don't want to use https in AWS, set the service endpoint to use http url.
    See http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Endpoints.html for DynamoDB.
