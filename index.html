    <p>
      Jsoda is a Java library providing a simple object layer over AWS API to
      simplify the storing of Java objects in the Amazon's SimpleDB and DynamoDB
      databases.  Java classes are used as table model to create the database
      tables.  Ordinary object instances (POJO) are stored as records in the
      tables.  Java primitive data types are automatically encoded in the database
      type to ensure correct querying and sorting.  DSL-style query methods make
      querying simple and easy.
